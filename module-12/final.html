                        One of my favorite hobbies is reading and I have loved it since I was a child. I have always been a huge fan of 19th century 
                        literature. I appreciated most of the novels that I had to read while in high school and learned to love various types
                        of writing.  Some of my favorite authors are Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, Elizabeth Gaskell, Ray Bradbury, and Franz Kafka.
                        My favorite books that I've read numerous times are Persuasion by Jane Austen, The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath, and Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.

                        I have always enjoyed video games as well. From the time when I was a little girl, they provided a way for me to spend 
                        time with my dad and brother growing up, but to also connect with my kids and husband as well. I think they are a great
                        way to unwind and relax, but to also challenge yourself as well. I like that they can be played with others and even
                        enjoyed alone.

                    I have always loved to watch movies for a long as I can remember. I remember spending many hours in video rental stores,
                    especially Blockbuster, trying to find that perfect movie to watch on a Friday night. Movies have always found a way to
                    help me get through many hard times as they enable me to find a place to get away for a little while without having to focus
                    on much. They also can make you think and see the world around you in different ways.

                        I've worked in medical billing in one way or another since I graduated high school in 2003.  I began working
                        in a doctors office and assisted patients while billing insurance companies. I also performed many other activities
                        in the office from coding to answering phones to taking payments.  After that I worked for a company that represented
                        many doctors across the United States doing the pathology billing.  I recently began a new job on the other side of 
                        medical billing field and am learning how to process claims.

                        After I graduated high school, it took several tries for me to get my first associate degree as I married too young 
                        initially and dropped out of school. I eventually had my daughter and decided to go back for computer programming. 
                        I went through a divorce and ended up getting my Associate degree rather than my Bachelor's Degree. 
                        
                        I feel as though this was an accomplishment though because I refused to quit even 
                        though I was going through a difficult time. I was able to raise a small child alone while working full time and 
                        going back to school. It was several years after that I was able to meet the love of my life and create a beautiful
                        blended family. Now, my husband and I are raising three kids together while working and going to school. I know 
                        that I can accomplish anything to support my family with my family supporting me.

                        I have not held a programming or IT type job yet in my career yet. I hope to be able to find something in the near
                        future, especially after I graduate.  I have always loved working with computers and creating anything that I could
                        with them. Every job I've held has related to computers in one way or another and I've learned new systems and programs.
                        I've also trained others on computers and spent a lot of time improving processes and creating documentation to use 
                        the computer for novices and experienced users alike. I think my future will be in computers much like my present is and my
                        past has been.
